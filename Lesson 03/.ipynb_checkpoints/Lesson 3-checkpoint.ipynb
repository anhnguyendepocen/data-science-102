    "\n",
    "In many situations, if you're working for a company, they will provide you the data. In a lot of these cases, the data is raw and dirty - as a data scientist, you'll learn how to filter this data, clean it up, and make sure it's usable for your models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this, if you were a competitive athlete, you wouldn't feed your body fast food - rather you'd ensure you were eating clean, nutritious meals. The same goes for our models in the future, we want to make sure we give it only the best data. Feeding it dirty data can be detrimental to our desired result.\n",
